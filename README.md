# hello-world
Like many of other millennials out there, I started working for large multinational companies in mid - 2000s and chose different ruts to pay my bill. Now I am finally enlightened and came out of it to start my own "thing", hence the name "Lost world". The "thing" is too early to be articulated so I will publish it as it gets more definite shape. Thank you for reading. Have a great day!!
